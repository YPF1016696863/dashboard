To deploy the server run:
docker-compose up

Now the db is persistent.
- to use the demo mysql, copy the mysql_data to /opt/redash
- postgres db has persistent data also in /opt/redash, so the manual steps below are only needed once if the storage
  is not deleted.

----
Manual steps first time (in another shell)
Run all scripts in order in /scripts folder
1. setup the db schema
2. setup the default user
3. setup the demo db

# demo db is now set up as part of the deployment file, the ROOT password used is rukshani, the port is not exposed externally but only part of the network
To add it manually, use the host name mysql_demo
